# advanced_keylogger

this program is in developement 

This program is in development.
I will expand this program to create a surveillance system and create a new repository for it.

###############################################################################################
Proposed functionality of the surveillance system:

-> record all keystrokes - implemented
-> hide the program from the task manager
-> screenshots (when visiting certain websites)
-> history of visited websites with a timestamp 
-> record communication via messenger (with word analyses)
-> video and microphone recording 
-> send an email with surveillance
-> create a backdoor using sockets (execute sys commands, download, upload files)
-> can be run on any OS
-> restrict access to specific programs (malware analyses tools etc.)
-> create secondary, tertiary persistence method
